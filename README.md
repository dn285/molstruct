# Molstruct

## Getting Started

In the project directory: Run `npm start` to open the React frontend. If nothing opens, you may need to manually navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port you have set for React) in the web browser of your choice. If you are only using Molstruct for the basic canvas functionality, you may stop here.

To spin up the backend, which is required for accessing naming functionality: Navigate to the backend folder, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the backend file with `python app.py`. It is recommended that this be done within a virtual environment.
